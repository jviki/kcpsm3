Tests can be run simply using script runtest.sh:
	$ ./runtest.sh

First compiles the pico in the ../src directory and then runs all packed tests.
Files *.in are source files with KCPSM3 assembler code and *.out files are
results from the original KCPSM3.EXE program provided by Xilinx.

The test 'extension' will fail unless you run the tests like this:
	$ ./runtest.sh -extension

Results from the tests are in files *.res and *.stderr. These files can be easily removed
simply calling:
	$ ./runtest.sh -clean

You can test also with valgrind:
	$ ./runtest.sh -valgrind
or
	$ ./runtest.sh -extension -valgrind

Output from valgrind is stored in the file <test>.stderr.

For debugging it is possible to compile with -DDEBUG flag (modify the Makefile or runtest.sh script
for that purpose). After that output from the assembler run is stored in the <test>.stderr file.

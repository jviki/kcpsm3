This is assembler for Xilinx processor KCPSM3. All C source codes are provided under GNU GPL license.
In the doc/ directory you can find a documentation. If you make any changes to the program, you can add
your stuff there.

Currently provided tests in directory test/ were downloaded from the internet (bleyer.org/pacoblaze; xilinx).
There are some my own tests.
